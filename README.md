# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
- 👋 Hi, I’m @MILOUDIAS, passionate about the intersection of technology and art, I am a multi-disciplinary maker who enjoys tinkering with electronics, building embedded systems, and exploring the world of computer graphics and 3D art. Driven by a constant desire to learn and create, I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible and finding new ways to bring my ideas to life. Whether it's designing a custom PCB or creating a stunning 3D render, I am always up for a new challenge and committed to delivering the best possible results.
